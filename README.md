This is xenos' WWIV 5 InterBBS Last Caller utility (xw5-ilc)

Currently consumes incoming InterBBS LastCaller rot47 posts from:

	fsxNet AREA: FSX_DAT
	WWIVnet Subtype: IBBSDAT hosted by @60

It will also post rot47 encoded ibbslastcall-data to the same SUB/Echo.

This utility was inspired by xqtr's ilc for MysticBBS.
